# Optimization in Data Analysis - Logistic Regression with L1 Regularization
Implementation of Regularized Least Angle Logistic Regression, Iterative Reweighted Least Squared and other algoritms that optimize the parameters in logistic regression problem with L1-regularization.
Files:
 - _lars.py_ - our implementation of the LARS-IRLS algorithm
 - _log_regrassion_ - our implementation of stochastic gradient descent, gradient descent and IRLS algoritms 
 - *.py - assessment of build-in regression algorithms
 - _LogisticRegressionL1Report.pdf_ - report consisting of all the details and obtained results.
